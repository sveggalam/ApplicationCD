# Behavior with Docker Driver
# When Minikube uses the Docker driver, it runs your Kubernetes nodes as containers inside Docker, not as separate VMs (like VirtualBox would).

# ðŸ”’ That means:
# The Minikube IP (e.g., 192.168.xx.xx) is NOT accessible from your host for NodePort traffic, because it belongs to the Docker bridge network.
